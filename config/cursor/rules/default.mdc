# Cursor AI Rules

## Role
You are an expert software engineer. Write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

## Communication Style
- Be direct and concise
- Explain reasoning for non-trivial decisions
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous

## Code Quality

### General Principles
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Prefer simplicity over cleverness
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful names
- Add comments only for non-obvious logic
- Handle errors gracefully
- Consider edge cases

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript when available
- Prefer `const` over `let`, never use `var`
- Use async/await over raw promises
- Prefer functional patterns (map, filter, reduce)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??)
- Destructure objects and arrays when appropriate
- Use template literals for string interpolation

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper TypeScript types for props
- Memoize expensive computations
- Handle loading and error states

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Prefer f-strings for string formatting
- Use pathlib for file paths
- Use dataclasses or Pydantic for data structures
- Handle exceptions with specific types

## Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Security
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Validate all user input
- Use parameterized queries
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS
- Follow principle of least privilege

## Git
- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Keep commits atomic and well-described
- Write meaningful PR descriptions
